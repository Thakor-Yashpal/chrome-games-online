The game was created by 
members of the Chrome UX team in 2014, which consisted of Sebastien Gabriel,
Alan Bettes, and Edward Jung.[9] Gabriel designed the player character, 
named the "Lonely T-Rex".[2] During development, the game was given the codename 
"Project Bolan", in reference to Marc Bolan, the lead singer of the T. Rex band.
The developers chose the dinosaur theme as a reference to the game's function,
a joke that not having an internet connection is equivalent to living in the "prehistoric ages".
The game was released in September 2014; initially, it did not work on older devices,
so the code was updated and re-released in December of the same year.[10]
The pteranodons were added as obstacles with a browser update in 2015.[11]

In September 2018, an Easter egg was added to the game in celebration of Chrome's 10th birthday 
and the game's fourth birthday, with a birthday cake appearing in the desert and a birthday hat 
appearing on the Lonely T-Rex if the cake is "eaten".[12] In November of the same year, Google 
introduced a feature to save the player's high score.[13] The game's source code is available on 
the Chromium site.[14]

In 2021, Google introduced a widget in March for iOS 14 which led players 
to chrome://dino;[15] a similar widget was introduced to Android later that year.
[16] In July, an Easter egg for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics simulating various Olympic 
activities was added.[17]
